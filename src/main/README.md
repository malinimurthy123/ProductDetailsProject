Retrieving the Product Details Using the Product ID.
DESCRIPTION

Create a servlet-based application that shows a form to enter a product ID. The product ID is then validated, and product details are retrieved from the database and displayed to the user. You need to create a product table in MySQL and prepopulate it with data. Use JDBC to do all database processing.


Background of the problem statement:
As a part of developing an e-commerce web application, the admin backend requires a module that can retrieve product information based on the product ID.

You must use the following:
●    Eclipse as the IDE
●    Apache Tomcat as the web server
●    MySQL Connector for JDBC functionality
Following requirements should be met:
●    Create an HTML page to take in a product ID
●    Set up JDBC to work with the application
●    Create a servlet that will take the product ID and use JDBC to query the database for the product
●    If the product is found, the servlet will display the product details, otherwise it will show an error message
●    Document the step-by-step process involved in completing this task
